# Raydium Volume Bot V3

This upgraded version automates the distribution of SOL across multiple wallets and executes simultaneous buy and sell swap transactions on the Raydium platform. 

## ðŸ”§ Version Improvements

### **Prev Version Limitations**
- **Repetitive Buy and Sell on a Single Wallet**: The prev iteration used fixed wallets, causing repetitive buy and sell actions that were seen on DexScreener.
- **Limited Maker Expansion**: The bot did not increase the number of market makers, only the trading volume.
- **Inefficient Token Gathering**: Tokens were gathered into the main wallet without being sold first, resulting in unnecessary token accumulation.
- **Unbalanced Buy and Sell Actions**: The one-time buy and sell actions led to excess sell pressure, as every buy was matched with a single sell, creating a consistent imbalance.

### **Enhancements**
- **Automated Wallet Rotation**: After completing a set of buy and sell transactions, SOL is transferred to a newly created wallet, ensuring continued activity and minimizing traceability.
- **Dynamic Maker Expansion**: New wallets are automatically created after each transaction cycle, increasing the number of market makers and further distributing trading volume.
- **Token Sell Before Gather**: Before gathering SOL, any remaining tokens are sold to prevent token accumulation in the wallet, ensuring more efficient use of funds.
- **Buy Pressure Optimization**: The bot performs two buys for each sell, maintaining a healthier buy-to-sell ratio and creating more buy pressure.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Automated SOL Distribution**: Distributes SOL to new wallets for consistent trading volume across multiple addresses.
- **Simultaneous Buy and Sell Operations**: Performs endless buy and sell swaps to maximize volume and market presence.
- **Jupiter V6 Swap Integration**: Leverages the Jupiter V6 swap aggregator for optimized token swaps.
- **Highly Configurable**: Allows customization of various parameters, such as buy amounts, intervals, distribution settings, and slippage.
